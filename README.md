# 🚀 AI Efficiency Handbooks

Welcome to the central repository for high-performance AI development. This collection synthesizes years of community knowledge (r/cursor, r/vibecoding) and professional engineering disciplines into 7 thematic handbooks.

## 📚 The Handbook Series

### 📘 [Handbook 1: Ultimate Cursor Rules & Best Practices](file:///Users/abhisheksinha/Desktop/tes/efficiency/handbook_1_ultimate_cursor_rules.md)
The definitive manual for configuring Cursor. Covers the Global vs. Project rule hierarchy, `.mdc` file structures, and the "reliability hierarchy" for maximum AI compliance.

### 🛠️ [Handbook 2: Cursor Troubleshooting & Reliability](file:///Users/abhisheksinha/Desktop/tes/efficiency/handbook_2_cursor_troubleshooting.md)
A diagnostic guide for when the AI "stops listening." Includes fixes for context rot, the "Annoyance-Driven" rule strategy, and the 10-point debug killer checklist.

### 🏗️ [Handbook 3: Professional Cursor Workflows & Scaling](file:///Users/abhisheksinha/Desktop/tes/efficiency/handbook_3_professional_cursor_workflows.md)
Advanced strategies for mid-to-large projects (50k+ LOC). Details internal memory systems, the `TODO.md` agentic loop, and "Roast" critique protocols.

### 🤖 [Handbook 4: Claude Code Mastery Guide](file:///Users/abhisheksinha/Desktop/tes/efficiency/handbook_4_claude_code_mastery.md)
The ultimate guide to the Claude Code CLI and agentic coding. Covers context engineering, safety hooks for "Dangerously Skip Permissions," and founder-level setup disciplines.

### 🌊 [Handbook 5: Vibe Coding & Prompting Playbook](file:///Users/abhisheksinha/Desktop/tes/efficiency/handbook_5_vibe_coding_playbook.md)
High-velocity development for the modern era. Features the "Farmer vs. Chef" philosophy, the GOAT workflow, and copy-paste prompts for rapid feature shipping.

### 🧠 [Handbook 6: Advanced Reasoning & Meta-Prompting](file:///Users/abhisheksinha/Desktop/tes/efficiency/handbook_6_advanced_reasoning.md)
Forcing deep, deliberative thought. Documentation for the "Contemplative Reasoning" protocol and the "Antigravity" meta-prompting framework to ensure 100% adherence.

### 📚 [Handbook 7: Stack-Specific Implementation Guides](file:///Users/abhisheksinha/Desktop/tes/efficiency/handbook_7_stack_specific_guides.md)
Targeted technical rules for specific frameworks: Next.js (App Router), Ruby on Rails (Hotwire), Flutter migrations, and living documentation maintenance.

## 🔑 Core Philosophy
1. **Evergreen Content**: All guides are generalized for long-term relevance (no dates or location anchors).
2. **Modular Knowledge**: Small, surgical rules are better than massive, vague instructions.
3. **Execution-First**: These handbooks are designed to be referenced *during* coding sessions, not just read once.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
- New to Cursor? Start with **Handbook 1**.
- Moving to large projects? Jump to **Handbook 3**.
- Using the Claude Code CLI? Go to **Handbook 4**.
